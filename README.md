Chatbot. It is specifically designed for academic related questions only. It has 2 modes of input: Text and voice. It uses NLP modules such as fuzzywuzzy to compare the question asked with the available questions in its question bank. If a similarity is found, it displays the corresponding answer from the answer bank. If a similar question is not found, it searches Wikipedia for an answer and displays the answer and the link for further reference.
