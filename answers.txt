The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change from one form to another. In any closed system, the total energy remains constant.
Meiosis is a type of cell division that occurs in sexually reproducing organisms. It results in four daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process involves two sequential divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, and is crucial for the formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells).
An allele is a variant form of a gene that occupies a specific location (locus) on a chromosome. Alleles can differ in their sequence of DNA, which can lead to variations in traits, such as eye color or blood type.
The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic, while solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. The pH is determined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the solution; higher H+ concentrations result in lower pH values, indicating greater acidity.
Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles found in eukaryotic cells. They are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of the cell because their primary function is to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the cell's main source of energy. Mitochondria have a double-membrane structure and contain their own DNA, suggesting an evolutionary origin from ancient symbiotic bacteria.
Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons between atoms. Atoms in covalent bonds share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. In contrast, ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons from one atom (cation) to another (anion). Ionic bonds result in the attraction between oppositely charged ions.
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun. This trapped heat warms the planet and is essential for maintaining a habitable temperature. However, an enhanced greenhouse effect, driven by increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, contributes to global warming and climate change.
Isotonic solutions have the same solute concentration as the cell. Hypertonic solutions have a higher solute concentration than the cell, causing water to leave the cell, potentially leading to cell shrinkage. Hypotonic solutions have a lower solute concentration than the cell, causing water to enter the cell, potentially leading to cell swelling or bursting.
The Bohr model describes the atom as having electrons orbiting the nucleus in specific energy levels or shells. Each shell corresponds to a specific energy level, and electrons occupy these shells in a quantized manner. This model helped explain the line spectra of elements.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy. It involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll in chloroplasts, the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, and the storage of energy in the form of chemical bonds.
The circulatory system, comprised of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, serves several essential functions. It transports oxygen and nutrients to body tissues, removes waste products, distributes hormones, regulates body temperature, and helps maintain pH and electrolyte balance.
Potential energy is stored energy related to an object's position or state. It includes gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, is the energy of an object in motion. It depends on the object's mass and velocity.
Newton's first law, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving with constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. It highlights the tendency of objects to maintain their state of motion.
Osmosis is the passive movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Diffusion, on the other hand, is the passive movement of particles (solutes) from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, equalizing the concentration.
DNA replication is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA to create two identical copies. It occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and involves the unwinding of the DNA double helix, complementary base pairing, and the synthesis of new DNA strands by DNA polymerase enzymes.
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy, can be naturally replenished and are considered sustainable. Non-renewable energy sources, like fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and nuclear energy, are finite and deplete over time.
Natural selection is a fundamental mechanism of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin. It posits that in a population, individuals with advantageous traits for their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to their offspring. Over time, this process leads to the adaptation and evolution of species.
Exothermic reactions release energy to their surroundings in the form of heat. They have a net negative change in enthalpy (∆H < 0). Endothermic reactions absorb energy from their surroundings, resulting in a net positive change in enthalpy (∆H > 0).
The nervous system transmits signals using specialized cells called neurons. Signals are transmitted as electrical impulses (action potentials) along the length of neurons. At synapses, these electrical signals are converted into chemical signals (neurotransmitters), which then influence the activity of adjacent neurons or target cells.
The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream. These hormones act as chemical messengers, regulating various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and homeostasis. Key glands include the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and pancreas.
Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. They are typically smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, membrane-bound organelles (such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum), and are found in multicellular organisms.
Genetic engineering is the deliberate modification of an organism's genetic material (DNA) using biotechnology techniques. This can involve inserting, deleting, or altering specific genes to achieve desired traits or outcomes, such as producing genetically modified crops or therapeutic proteins.
The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection when light interacts with a smooth surface. The law of refraction states that when light passes from one medium to another, it changes direction, and the angle of incidence and angle of refraction are related by the refractive indices of the materials involved.

The first law, known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. The second law states that in any energy transfer or transformation, the total entropy (disorder) of a closed system tends to increase over time, making some processes irreversible.
Vaccines stimulate the immune system by introducing a harmless form of a pathogen (antigen) or its components. This triggers an immune response, including the production of antibodies. If the person is later exposed to the actual pathogen, their immune system recognizes it and mounts a rapid, effective defense.
The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment. It includes the nose, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. Oxygen is inhaled and transported to cells for energy production, while carbon dioxide is exhaled as a waste product.
The Golgi apparatus (Golgi body) modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids produced by the endoplasmic reticulum. It prepares these molecules for transport within the cell or for secretion outside the cell. It plays a crucial role in cellular trafficking and secretion.
Half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to decay, transforming into another element or isotope. It is a characteristic property of each radioactive substance and is used for dating fossils, archaeological artifacts, and studying nuclear processes.
Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving, regardless of direction. Velocity is a vector quantity that specifies both the speed and direction of motion. It includes information about an object's change in position over time.
Mountains are typically formed through geological processes, such as tectonic plate movements. One common process involves the collision of two tectonic plates, leading to the uplift of the Earth's crust. Additionally, erosion and volcanic activity can contribute to mountain formation.
Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They consist of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins and exist in two subunits (small and large). Ribosomes read the mRNA code and facilitate the assembly of amino acids into a polypeptide chain, a crucial step in protein production.
White blood cells (leukocytes) are vital components of the immune system. They help defend the body against infections and foreign invaders by detecting and destroying pathogens, producing antibodies, and coordinating immune responses.
Electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge at a specific point in an electric field. Voltage, often referred to as electric potential difference, represents the energy required to move a unit charge between two points in an electric circuit. It is measured in volts (V).
Autotrophs are organisms that can produce their own food using sunlight (photosynthesis) or inorganic compounds (chemosynthesis). They are often called producers. Heterotrophs, in contrast, cannot produce their own food and must obtain energy and nutrients by consuming other organisms. They are consumers.
The greenhouse effect, while essential for maintaining a habitable climate, can lead to an increase in Earth's average temperature when enhanced by elevated levels of greenhouse gases. These gases trap heat from the sun, raising global temperatures, a phenomenon referred to as global warming.
Protein synthesis involves two main steps: transcription and translation. Transcription occurs in the nucleus, where a copy of the DNA code is made into messenger RNA (mRNA). Translation takes place in the ribosomes, where the mRNA code is read, and amino acids are assembled into a protein.
A cation is a positively charged ion formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. An anion is a negatively charged ion formed when an atom gains one or more electrons. Their charges result from an imbalance between protons (positively charged) and electrons (negatively charged).
Meiosis is a specialized cell division process that reduces the chromosome number by half and produces gametes (sperm and egg cells) in sexually reproducing organisms. It introduces genetic diversity through processes like crossing-over, independent assortment, and random fertilization.
Isaac Newton formulated three laws of motion: Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Newton's Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force applied to it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma). Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
Natural selection is a mechanism of evolution where individuals with advantageous traits have a better chance of surviving and reproducing in a given environment. Over generations, these traits become more common in a population, leading to the adaptation and evolution of species.
DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) has a double helix structure composed of two long chains (strands) of nucleotides twisted around each other. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar-phosphate backbone and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G). A pairs with T, and C pairs with G.
Major types of chemical reactions include: Synthesis (combination) reactions Decomposition reactions Single displacement reactions Double displacement reactions Combustion reactions Acid-base reactions
Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose and other organic molecules to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency. It occurs in three stages: glycolysis (in the cytoplasm), the citric acid cycle (in the mitochondria), and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria).
Genotype refers to an organism's genetic makeup, including all the genes it carries in its DNA. Phenotype, on the other hand, refers to the observable traits and characteristics that result from an organism's genotype and its interaction with the environment.
Electromagnetic waves vary in energy and frequency across the electromagnetic spectrum. Generally, waves with higher energy have higher frequencies. The spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays, in order of increasing energy.
Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It plays a crucial role in growth, development, tissue repair, and asexual reproduction.
The chemical formula of water is H₂O, indicating that each molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms (H) covalently bonded to one oxygen atom (O).
The theory of relativity, formulated by Albert Einstein, includes two major theories: special relativity and general relativity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, while general relativity extends these principles to include gravity's effects on spacetime.
The atomic bomb was developed during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project, led by American physicists, including J. Robert Oppenheimer. The project resulted in the successful creation and deployment of the first atomic bombs.
The first successful test of an atomic bomb, code-named "Trinity," took place on July 16, 1945, in the desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico, USA. This test confirmed the feasibility of atomic weapons. 
A blackhole is an entity in space which is believed to have such high gravitational pull that it doesn't let light escape.
